# Annotation-Schema-Diagnostic

*Beyond Black-Box Labels: Interpretable Criteria for Diagnosing Subjective NLP Tasks* (accepted at **ACL Findings 2026**).

## Description
We propose a schema-level diagnostic for auditing expert-designed annotation schemas prior to gold-label commitment. The diagnostic separates two failure modes:

* **Criterion instability**: criteria with hard-to-operationalize boundaries.
* **Criterion overlap**: criteria that systematically co-activate and blur category boundaries.

Applied to Persuasive Value Extraction in B2B commercial documents, we show that disagreement is structured: instability concentrates in a few criteria, while nearly half of covered sentences activate multiple categories.

## Data

The annotation tensor and anonymized human annotations are released in this repository. Raw source documents are not released due to client confidentiality. All diagnostic procedures are fully specified and applicable to other datasets.

## Structure

- `data/anonymized/` — anonymized human annotations (`human_annotations_merged.csv`).
- `data/original/` — placeholder (not released — confidential).
- `data/tensors/` — LLM annotation tensor (`tensor_raw_4700.npy`, shape `4700 × 11 × 6`) and metadata (`mapping.json`).
- `notebooks/` — analysis notebooks reproducing all paper results.
  - `00_inspect_tensor.ipynb` — tensor explorer.
  - `01_instability_analysis.ipynb` — Table 1, Figure 2.
  - `02_overlap_analysis.ipynb` — Table 2, Figure 3.
  - `03_human_validation.ipynb` — Table 3.
  - `04_model_sensitivity.ipynb` — Appendix K.
  - `05_refinement_analysis.ipynb` — Appendix L.
- `scripts/` — data preparation and annotation pipeline.
  - `00_prepare_sentences.py` — Excel → anonymized CSV.
  - `01_anonymize_sentences.py` — anonymization + EN translation.
  - `02_generate_prompts.py` — per-criterion JSON prompts.
  - `03_run_llm_annotation.py` — LLM annotation via API.
  - `04_build_tensor.py` — aggregate responses → tensor.
  - `05_prepare_human_annotations.py` — merge expert annotation files.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

    abstract = "Subjective NLP datasets typically aggregate annotator judgments into a single gold label, making it difficult to diagnose whether disagreement reflects unclear criteria, collapsed distinctions, or legitimate plurality. We propose a schema-level diagnostic for auditing expert-designed annotation schemas prior to gold-label commitment, using only multi-annotator criterion judgments. The diagnostic separates two failure modes: unstable criteria with hard-to-operationalize boundaries, and systematic overlap that blurs the boundaries between mutually exclusive categories. Applied to persuasive value extraction in commercial documents, we find that disagreement is not diffuse: instability concentrates in a few criteria, while nearly half of covered sentences activate multiple categories. These signals align with where domain experts disagree, yielding an evidence-based audit for tightening guidelines, revising category structure, or reconsidering the annotation paradigm."
